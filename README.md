Project: Real-Time IoT Environmental Monitoring System Goal To monitor environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, CO₂ levels) in real-time and display the data through a dashboard. The system could send alerts if certain thresholds are crossed (e.g., temperature is too high, CO₂ levels are critical).
